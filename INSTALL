Idea and design (template) by Tycho2

Fill out the admin/config.php (rename "config-EXAMPLE.php") file and upload all files to your webserver. Requires PHP and MySQL with the MySQLi extension.

For enhanced security .htaccess- and .htpasswd-protect the admin folder (otherwise everybody can access the admin panel and probably even do some SQL injection from there)
